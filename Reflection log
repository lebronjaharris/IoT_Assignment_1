I have learned a lot from these classes. I learned how to briefly program with Python, how to use the Raspberry Pi, and how to work with the terminal and command prompt on my computer.
The difficult parts were understanding how the terminal and command prompt work, and how to properly navigate them.
The instructions and the step-by-step guide made it 100 times easier to understand everything I was doing, what to do and how to do it.
I need to improve my knowledge of how to properly navigate through computers and how to program.
Honestly, the teacher did everything perfectly. He went slowly during the creation of the program so I could take my time and fully understand. The guides and instructions were very helpful, and he helped me a lot with all my questions.
I honestly could have paid more attention in class and avoided missing any classes to further enhance my learning.
